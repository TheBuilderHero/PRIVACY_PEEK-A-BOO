## Overview

PRIVACY_PEEK-A-BOO is an innovative security solution designed to enhance user privacy by evaluating the privacy policies of websites visited through a Chrome extension. This tool aims to provide users with a summarized overview of how their data is being used by different websites, making it easier for them to understand and manage their online privacy.

## Features

### Chrome Extension
- PRIVACY_PEEK-A-BOO is implemented as a Chrome extension, making it easily accessible to users who use the Chrome web browser.
  
### Web Scraper for Privacy Policy
- The extension utilizes a web scraper to extract the privacy policy text from the visited websites automatically.

### HTML Element for Report Generation
- An HTML element is dynamically generated to inform users when a privacy report has been successfully generated for the visited website.

### Data Storage and Communication
- The extracted privacy policy text, along with the URL of the visited website and the user's email, is sent to a server.
- The server then stores this data in a MongoDB database for future reference and analysis.

### Integration with ChatGPT-3.5 API
- PRIVACY_PEEK-A-BOO communicates with the ChatGPT-3.5 API to generate a summarized overview and advice on how the user's data is being used based on the extracted privacy policy.
- A special server prompt is used to instruct ChatGPT-3.5 to summarize the web-scraped privacy policy document.

### User-Friendly Display
- The summarized privacy policy information and advice generated by ChatGPT-3.5 are routed back to the visited website to be displayed to the user.
- A confirmation message is sent back to the Chrome extension to notify the user that the report is ready.
